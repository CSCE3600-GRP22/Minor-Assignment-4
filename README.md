# Minor-Assignment-4
Minor Assignment 4, create a C program to set up Bash++
Bash ++ removes the quirks of bash mainly:
  -removes the need to have no whitespace inbetween assignment statements
    -ex. num = 4 is valid
  -removes the need for there to be whitespace in the brackets of if, while, until statements
  -the then and do after if while and until statements do not need to be on a different line or seperated by a ;
